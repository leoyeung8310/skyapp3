  "Challenge You description": "\"Challenge You\" is a simple online community system based on the experimental platform called SkyApp v3.0, which is the third major release of an ongoing research project on education technology. The research objective of SkyApp is to explore novel ways of capturing and analyzing fine-grained learning behaviours of learners. \"Challenge You\" offers an easy-to-use web-based interface for learners to set up questions (challenges) in a few simple steps. Interactions of peers can then be easily built up. It therefore aims to promote peer-to-peer learning through community-based sharing.",
